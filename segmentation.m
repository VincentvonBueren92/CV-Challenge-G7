function [mask] = segmentation(left,right)
    %% This function is used to segment moving elements. 
    %For this purpose N elements are passed as RGB tensors in the input 
    % variable "left". The function calculates an average image from the
    % N elements, from which the average image (round(N/2)) of the N
    % transferred images is subtracted. In a further step the resulting 
    % difference image, which is still an RGB image, is converted into a 
    % gray image. From this gray image a binary image is created in a 
    % further step. This binary image, which is partly still noisy, is 
    % then converted into a noise-free binary image using several filters.
    % Gaussian filters ensure a better filling of the images. The Gaussian
    % filters result in a mask with too large outcuts.  To reduce this mask 
    % a negative image is created. A Gaussian filter is applied to 
    % the created nagitve image, which enlarges the mask of the nagitve 
    % image. Since the negative mask is now enlarged, a new negation of 
    % the negative mask will result in a binary image which is smaller 
    % than the original mask.
